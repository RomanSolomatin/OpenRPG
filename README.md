# OpenRPG
### Welcome! In this repository you will find a great powerful, well commented and structured API that will be the base of your RPG game!

## Inventory System
  Has common functions like Split, Drop, Swap, Drag & Drop, Add, Remove, etc). Supports different types of items (consumable, equipment, material, quest, miscellaneous) very easy to add and modify via DataTable. Also each item can execute custom logic when used. 
## Equipment System
  Has multi-slots (helment, armor, weapon, shield, boots, etc) and you can have different attributes for each one, making them unique even if they are from the same class!
## HotKeyBar System
You can drag & drop items from the inventory and assign them to the slots! Just add the keys that you want to an array and it will be generated!

## Stats system
(Add e_BarRegenMode) Allows you to have different bars (comes with health, mana and exp as examples) with custom behavior like regen/drain, etc. Also you can have your own stats (comes with 19 as examples) and add custom function logic when anyone is changed, very useful for movement speed, attack speed and so on. 

Every system has Save/Load functionality in a .sav file located in external folder just pressing a key during gameplay!

Future systems to be implemented:

- Quest system
- Dialogue system
- Combat system
- Minimap system
- Ability system
- Crafting system
- Multipurpose NPC system
