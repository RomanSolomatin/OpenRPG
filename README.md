# OpenRPG
Welcome to my repository, be patient im new at this!
At the moment i have implemented 3 systems:

- Inventory System:
  Has common functions like Split, Drop, Swap, Drag & Drop, Add, Remove, etc). Supports different types of items (consumable, equipment, material, quest, miscellaneous) very easy to add and modify via DataTable. Also each item can execute custom logic when used. 
- Equipment System (working hand by hand with the Inventory):
  Has multi-slots (helment, armor, weapon, shield, boots, etc) and you can have different attributes for each one, making them unique even if they are from the same class!
- HotKeyBar System (working hand by hand with the Inventory): You can drag & drop items from the inventory and assign them to the slots! Just add the keys that you want to an array and it will be generated!

Every system has Save/Load functionality in a .sav file located in external folder just pressing a key during gameplay!

Future systems to be implemented:
- Stats system
- Quest system
- Dialogue system
- Combat system
- Minimap system
- Ability system
